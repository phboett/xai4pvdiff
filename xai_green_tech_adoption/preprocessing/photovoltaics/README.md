# README

This folder contains the code requires to replicate all findings presented in the paper. It is structed as follows:

*preprocessing.photovoltaics* 
The folder contains all scripts and notebooks required to preprocess raw data to arrive at the input dataset to the simulations of the PV systems given in the folder *data/input*. The scripts and notebooks should be executed in the specified order:

- *handling_changes_in_AGS.ipynb*
- *preprocess_inkar.ipynb*
- *preprocess_census.ipynb*
- *preprocess_regional_database.ipynb*
- *preprocess_radiation_data.ipynb*
